The purpose of this test suite is to test that query identifiers are case insensitive and case preserving.

TODO: these test cases below should be added when bugs are fixed and design is solidified.
	-- Hanifi is writing a document that should be referenced here.
	-- Add test cases for aliases
	-- Add cases for : DRILL-1911, DRILL-1913
	-- Cases with the same column name after DRILL-2036 is fixed
	-- Verify bugs when they are fixed (.fail files) 
	-- manual test should be fixed to nuke table files from the file system
