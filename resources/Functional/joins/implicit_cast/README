* This suite is meant to be executed with: 
	alter system set `planner.enable_hashjoin_swap` = false;
	alter system set `planner.enable_mergejoin` = false;

* Make sure suite is run with additional permutations:
        * only hash/merge join enabled at a time
        * To generate distributed plan:
		alter system set `planner.slice_target` = 1;
		alter system set `planner.enable_broadcast_join` = false;
